            Hi! I'm Patrice Virata. My major is MIS. I was born and raised in the Philippines and moved to Omaha, Nebraska in 2010. 
            I have two cats. My hobbies are playing video games, learning about cars, watercolor painting, and do my own nails!
            I like to socialize and also make friends! It's nice to meet you!
